## Team name
__Igloo__

## Team members
* Mohamed Sakr
* April Pan
* Gord Mok
* Mihoko Schick

## Selected Technology

* Node (Express, Ejs)
* WebRTC - Video
* SocketIO - Chat
* React
* Peer.js
* MySQL

## Reason for choosing this technology

* Most suitable and well documented
* Large number of well-developed 3rd party libraries
* Suitable for IO intensive applications due to its design

## Project description
Igloo is a video conference and chat, much like Zoom. Igloo will allow users to sign up for a user account and then host or join video conferences with other parties. Video conferences will take place inside protected virtual rooms to maintain privacy of the conversation.

## Targeted audience and objective
Igloo will target young users and professionals who need to meet with others in a private setting to chat or converse over video and text chat.


## Technical considerations (languages, framework, libraries, database, API)
JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, EJS, WebRTC, SocketIO, React, Peer.js, MySQL/Sequelize.

The MERN (MySql, Express, React, Node) stack will be used for the Igloo app due to its ability to handle high volume IO operations, abundant resources, and extensive third party libraries.
